To use GChat implement the JavaScript-Frontend and connect it to the PHP-Core.

You need to create two Tables "online_users" and "messages". Please see for reference the two image files in the archive.

Please be informed that you have to put in your DB data into the Sql_Connector-Class, for Database-Connection.

If you have any Question about the implementation of GChat write us a message to: ocd@goldwingstudios.de

Thank you for using GChat!
